# Spark! 
#### **_Its the first step_** 


## What is Spark!
- It is a website for selecting resolutions.
- It displays the roadmap for completing the desired resolution.
- Helping people decide and complete their resolutions is the main idea behind this website.

## How does it help?
- Spark! will provide the users with a roadmap on how they can successfully complete their resolution.
- It also has something called _the fates_ , its a spinning wheel which would help the user pick a resolution. 
- It also has the feature of sharing one's resolution with the world. Once the user selects their social handle they will be provided with an automatically generated message/ tweet/ cation, encouraging them to share their resolution.
